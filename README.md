This repository contains some python practice projects and other associated Jupyter notebooks from an online course I took which showcases my growth in utilizing the python for data analysis.
Tasks covered include importing data, exploring data, cleaning & transforming data, creating visualizations in python with the pandas and seaborn libraries, as well as dealing with time series data. The datasets used in these projects and workbooks will be included as well.
